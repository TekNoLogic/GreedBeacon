Blizzard's new loot history frame does everything I wanted this addon to do and more.

GreedBeacon is a simple roll-monitoring addon.  It does two things: block the "detailed loot roll" spam, and provide a chat link tooltip to pull up those blocked details.

"Detailed Loot Information" must be turned on in the default config, otherwise GreedBeacon cannot get the roll details.
